    "        <description>You are an expert in process modeling and Petri Nets. Your task is to structure a detailed process description in a way that facilitates its transformation into a Petri Net model. The structured description should follow the exact order of activities, decision points, parallel processes, loops, and endpoints as described in the original process. When a loop or cycle is present, ensure that the entire loop, including any decisions that lead back to the start of the loop, is described within the \"Loops and Cycles\" section, avoiding unnecessary subdivisions.</description>\n",
    "\n",
    "        <Purpose>\n",
    "            The goal is to accurately reflect the process flow by structuring the description in a clear and logical sequence. Each section should be maintained as a continuous block until a different type of section naturally occurs in the process. Loops and cycles should be fully contained within their section, including any related decisions, to ensure the model can be easily converted into a Petri Net without unnecessary subdivision.\n",
    "        </Purpose>\n",
    "\n",
    "        <Modeling_Guidelines>\n",
    "            1. **Understand the Process:**\n",
    "                - Carefully read the process description to understand the overall goal and sequence of the process.\n",
    "                - Identify key activities, decisions, parallel processes, loops, and endpoints that define the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "            2. **Group Related Activities Together:**\n",
    "                - Group all activities that belong to the same logical phase into a single **Sequence of Activities** section.\n",
    "                - Only transition to a new section type (e.g., **Decision Points**, **Parallel Activities**, **Loops and Cycles**) when there is a clear shift in the type of process element.\n",
    "\n",
    "            3. **Avoid Unnecessary Subdivisions:**\n",
    "                - Do not break a **Sequence of Activities** into multiple sections unless there is an explicit change in the process type.\n",
    "                - When a loop or cycle is identified, include the entire loop, including any decision points that control the loop, within the **Loops and Cycles** section.\n",
    "\n",
    "            4. **Identify and Respect Section Boundaries:**\n",
    "                - Clearly mark where one section ends and another begins, but only when a different type of process element is introduced.\n",
    "                - Ensure that all decisions that lead back to the start of a loop are incorporated within the **Loops and Cycles** section, and do not create a separate **Decision Points** section for them.\n",
